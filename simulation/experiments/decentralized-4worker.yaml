# Configuration with simple dispatcher and no self-adaptive strategy (ref. baseline).
# This configuration makes all 4 workers active and since there is no SA, they remain active the whole time.

# Workers could be either a number or a list that explicitly states a collection of attributes
# If only a number is given, the workers are initialized with no attributes at the beginning.

  - active: true
  - active: true
